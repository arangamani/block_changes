{"name":"Block changes","tagline":"Ruby Module for Detecting Variable Changes in a Block","body":"Block Changes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nDetecting changes in a Ruby block\r\n---------------------------------\r\nThe following example illustrates how to see if changes are detected in a Ruby block for the expected variables. Variables a, b, c are concerned in this example. Just keep the code that changes the variables of your concern inside a block and pass the block to `detect_changes` and pass in these variables as a parameter to `detect_changes`. Note that these parameters should be in quotes. If these variables are changed `changes_detected?` will return true. If these variables are not changes in the block `changes_detected?` will return false. This will be helpful to maintain idempotency. The following example is very simple. We'll know what variables we concern about when we write the code so passing those variables to the code will not be hard. Also we might not want to detect changes of local temporary variables defined inside the block.\r\n\r\nInstall the gem using the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngem install block_changes\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'block_changes'\r\n\r\ninclude BlockChanges\r\n\r\na = 1\r\nb = 2\r\nc = 3\r\n\r\n# Note that the variable names are in quotes and it is required.\r\ndetect_changes('a', 'b', 'c') do\r\n  a = 2\r\n  b = 3\r\n  c = 4\r\nend\r\n\r\n# Check if changes are detected in the block\r\nputs \"Changes Detected\" if changes_detected?\r\n\r\n# Check the number variables changed in the block\r\nputs \"No of changes: #{get_changes}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently Supported and tested variable types:\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* Regular Ruby variables like string and Fixunm\r\n* Arrays and Hashes\r\n\r\nIt might just work with other custom types as long as they can be compared with the `=` operator.\r\n\r\nReporting Issues:\r\n-----------------\r\nIf you find any issue with this project, please report them at the Github issues.\r\n\r\nContributing:\r\n-------------\r\nIf you would like to contribute to this project, just do the following:\r\n\r\n1.
